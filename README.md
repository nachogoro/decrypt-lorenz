# Introduction
Short question for a Cryptography subject in university.

Two four-letter words in Spanish have been encrypted with Lorenz's method, and the result is
* WORD 1: 20, 24, 24, 21
* WORD 2: 16, 24, 25, 27

Knowing that the key is also 4 letters long and that the encoding is: A=0, B=1, C=2, D=3... What are the possible plain texts?

# Compilation
Compile with:
```
